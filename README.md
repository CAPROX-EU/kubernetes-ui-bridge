# kubernetes-ui-bridge
Kubernetes UI based on Redhat's openshift console packaged as a helm chart.
USE IT WITH CAUTION!
At the moment the api is exposed over the ingress!!! 
Please only use it when you understand what this chart does. 

WIP it works but you can not configure anything at the moment!

If you have question feel free to open an Issue.
